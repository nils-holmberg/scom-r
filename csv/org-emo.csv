They focus on arts  education  environment  disability & health  community and social welfare.    Scheme details  The Woodward Charitable Trust is a grant-making trust and is one of the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts. The Trust primarily funds charitable organisations in the UK. If we fund overseas projects it is usually via UK charities which can ensure that funds are being well used. We favour charities which make good use of volunteers and encourage past and current users to participate. The grants we make are for a wide range of activities.    Their current funding priorities include:  • Children and young people who are isolated  at risk of exclusion or involved in anti-social behaviour.  • Minority groups including refugees  gypsies and travellers. Projects that promote integration and community cohesion will be favoured.  • Prisoners and ex-offenders. Projects that help the rehabilitation and resettlement of prisoners and/or ex-offenders are supported as well as requests to help prisoners’ families.  • Disability projects  which can include rehabilitation and training for people who are either physically disabled or learning disabled as well as help to improve employment prospects.  • Homelessness  especially affecting young people and women  and covering facilities such as women s refuges.  • Arts outreach work by local groups involving disadvantaged people.  • Environmental projects  especially with a strong educational element.    The Trust prefers to fund small to medium-sized charities with an income of less than £300 000. The majority of our grants are for one-off projects although we may fund salaries and running costs. The Trust receives many more applications than it has funds to support.     For further information  see www.woodwardcharitabletrust.org.uk  or contact@woodwardcharitabletrust.org.uk."

Well: they won and here s why.  Read Roy s story:  Roy  75-year-old Roy McCullough from Derry was diagnosed with prostate cancer 12 years ago.  He is one of the many people in Northern Ireland now living with cancer as a long term condition.  Back in 2002  he had to travel to Belfast for two months of intensive treatment  after which he says he felt “abandoned”.  He says cancer care and aftercare has been transformed over the past few years and patients now have more and more support to get back into their normal routine:   “Consultant oncologists aren’t available at the drop of a hat.  You may only see them once a year.    “The rest of the time I know now that  if I have any concerns  I can phone my Clinical Nurse Specialist and she’ll talk things through or get things rolling.   “I don’t want anyone thinking I’m on the phone all the time but knowing there’s an expert there to talk to is what’s important.”  Roy believes the role of Cancer Nurse Specialists is key to the success of the new system of aftercare and has joined a local support group for men going through treatment and living with prostate cancer."

I had a brain tumour so I needed surgery  as well as radiotherapy and chemotherapy.   “Because of my treatment I couldn’t do full days in school  but I tried to go as much as possible for the support of my friends and to keep myself positive.   “Because of where my tumour was  it pressed up against my optic nerves so I have no peripheral vision and I have no depth perception. When I first got diagnosed I was really insecure  I couldn’t go out by myself  and when friends went out I couldn’t go because I couldn’t see properly would feel really nervous.  “When I got to meet my Cancer Fund for Children Specialist Caitriona  it was amazing. She’d take me out and we’d get coffee or hot chocolate  and just talk about how things were going. I don’t know where I would be if I hadn’t had Caitriona to talk to  I wouldn’t have been as positive.  “Without your donations  the people who work at these brilliant charities wouldn’t be there.

Robinson  MLA and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness  MLA have announced the first projects to be funded through the Social Investment Fund (SIF) programme  £33million will be invested in 12 capital projects and 11 revenue projects  aimed at tackling poverty and deprivation through improved community based services and facilities. The First Minister  Peter Robinson said: “I welcome this £33million investment in projects to deliver the Social Investment Fund programme. An enormous amount of work has been done by Steering Groups to identify projects that will address the issues affecting the communities that are most in need in each area.  Today’s announcement of the first 23 projects confirms where almost half of the Social Investment Fund will be spent. We are determined to see all £80million of this important fund allocated in the coming months.”  The listed projects have been identified as priorities by Steering Groups in each zone.  Letters of offer will be issued to the successful projects following completion of verification and governance checks which are now taking place.Work is continuing to bring forward further projects which are expected to be ready to start later this year.  The Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said: “Through the Steering Groups local people have identified and prioritised the areas of need to ensure the maximum impact of the overall £80million Social Investment Fund.  This is only the start and I am confident this funding will enable groups to deliver real benefits for people on the ground. The funding will result in jobs  training and improved facilities for many of the hardest hit areas of our community.”  A list of projects to be offered funding is available at:   http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-ofmdfm-100214-robinson-andmcguinness.htm   "	"Supporting Communities"	1392670070	"en"

This is one of the reasons Cancer Fund for Children means so much to me. Seeing the help they provide and hearing just how much it means to the families they support is a very humbling experience. When you start volunteering you realise it is like a little family.  Everyone knows each other  and many have been volunteering for years.” Lynette is calling for others to get involved too: “I would simply say stop thinking and just do it. You’ll not be sorry that you have.  Why would you not when all you have to do is donate some of your time. It costs you nothing but in turn helps a fantastic charity to do some wonderful things for families going through such a tough time.” Read more: http://bit.ly/1Og15QQ"	"Cancer Fund For Children"	1465559700	"en"

Action Cancer  in partnership with the Science Shop at the Ulster University  is carrying out research to explore how information about support services is communicated to young people affected by cancer.    From this research we hope to develop more effective ways of communicating this information. This research is part of a Dissertation for a student completing BSc Communication.  We are inviting parents of young people affected by cancer to participate in this research. If you decide to participate  you will be asked to attend a focus group (small group discussion) to discuss parental needs when caring for your child.    The focus group will provide you with the opportunity to give your views on the issues that are most pertinent to you as parents/guardians.  In doing so  it is hoped that a number of views can be considered when trying to improve the care of young people both with a cancer diagnosis and those affected by cancer.  We plan to hold the focus groups at Action Cancer House  1 Marlborough Park  Belfast between 6pm and 8pm on 17th and 24th February 2015.  If you are interested in taking part  or would like more information  please contact Dr Caroline Hughes at Action Cancer on 02890803344 or email chughes@actioncancer.org  or Niall Connor on 07935639937 or email nconnor1989@gmail.com.  * Focus groups will be recorded for analysis.

I was due to go for a bone marrow transplant but unfortunately I relapsed just before I was due to go - you have to be in remission to get a transplant.  “Unfortunately I found out that the type of cancer I had was now immune to the chemotherapy treatment I was on.   “So my only option was to go to London to try a new trial drug that opened up. My mum had to quit work and we both went to stay in London for three months to undergo this new treatment. Thankfully it worked and I went in to remission and was eventually able to get my transplant.  “Cancer Fund for Children were amazing support to me during that time. They helped us financially  providing us with a grant to help my family with the costs of travelling to hospital  and to London for treatment.  “They also supported me emotionally. I was able to go to Daisy Lodge and spend time with other young people who were going through the same thing. Whilst I was in hospital for treatment  I was isolated and never got to see other young people so it was great to be able to talk to other people who knew what it was like to have cancer.”  Megan is bravely opening up about her experience with cancer to encourage local people to do what they can to support families just like hers.

By taking on Northern Ireland’s highest peak  you could help support young people who are struggling to cope with the impact of a parental cancer diagnosis.  Young people who have a parent diagnosed with cancer are often under enormous stress in their young lives – from worrying about loved ones to taking on extra responsibilities such as housework and caring for siblings  in addition to their own school work.  Funds raised through the Slieve Donard Climb could for example provide these young people  like the one quoted above  with the unique opportunity of completing their Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award.  As part of this Award  young people affected by cancer will learn a new skill  volunteer their time to help others as well as demonstrate physical ability and team work by taking on expeditions in the outdoors  some of which often take place in the Mourne Mountains.  Through the support of Cancer Fund for Children and the Duke of Edinburgh Programme  these young people can push their own boundaries  make new friendships and learn how to receive and give support to other young people going through the same thing as them.

The Commission has created three registration lists with each containing a directory of organisations which will be called forward to register. The three lists are:    -Deemed list: organisations registered with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for charitable tax exemptions by 19th August 2013. This list is set in law and cannot be changed  or added to. This list is available on the Commission’s website www.charitycommissionni.org.uk     -Non-deemed list: all other charitable organisations  whether long or newly established  which are not registered with HMRC. Organisations will be added to this list as they come forward.    -Special circumstances list: organisations which have made a case to have their application brought forward or have been placed on this list by the Commission. Organisations can only be added to this list by the Commission.    The Commission will call forward organisations from each of the three lists in set tranches over the coming years  ensuring that registration can be managed in a fair and efficient manner.  In order to ensure your organisation will be called forward  the Commission would therefore urge all charities in Northern Ireland to check the online deemed list and undertake one of the  following actions  as appropriate:    If you are on the deemed list and the details are correct - you don’t need to take any action at this stage. The Commission will be in touch with you regarding registration in due course.    In the future  you will be able to check the Commission’s website to see which tranche you will be called forward in.    -If you are on the deemed list but the details are incorrect– please update the Charity Commission by emailing your organisation’s name  the information to be updated and your contact details to admin@charitycommissionni.org.uk.    -If you are not on the deemed list but you think you held charitable tax status granted by HMRC before 19th August 2013 – please email admin@charitycommissionni.org.uk with your charity name  contact name  telephone number  postal address  email address   HMRC reference number and the approximate date on which charitable tax status was granted.    -If you are not on the deemed list and you were granted charitable tax status by HMRC after 19th August 2013 – please complete the online Expression of intent form to provide your details to the Commission enabling you to be called forward to apply for charity  registration.    -If you are not on the deemed list and have never applied for charitable tax status by HMRC – please complete the online Expression of intent form to provide your details to the  Commission enabling you to be called forward to apply for charity registration.    -If you think there are special circumstances which will apply to your registration - for example you think you are one of a number of similar organisations that could be assessed as a grouped registration or you need to use a particular power set out in the Charities Act for which registration is a condition.     Please complete the online Expression of intent form   outlining any special circumstances which you think apply in your case.

Instead she decided to put the valuable skills she’d learned through her working life to good use and became a lead volunteer for a Community Helper Scheme with Macmillan. As lead volunteer Joan does a bit of everything  from interviewing  training and mentoring new volunteers  right through to leading the team in the community helping out with housework and befriending. Having initially started out looking after the Bangor and Newtownards area  Joan now refers to herself as a ‘floating lead volunteer’ as she has since taken on looking after schemes in North and West Belfast too. A member of the Volunteer Forum  Joan transmits the views of volunteers back to Macmillan  she also proof reads new information literature and is also an ambassador for the charity. Last year Joan was awarded the Richard Hambro award in recognition for all her efforts for Macmillan in Northern Ireland. Joan feels that volunteering gives her a great focus  as well as getting her out and about meeting new people in lots of different places.

Until you are in the situation yourself  you really don’t know how invaluable Cancer Fund for Children’s services are  but please believe me when I say that every donation will have a huge impact on the lives of local families who have a child with cancer.

Thomas’ mum Gillian said; “Thomas was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia last November and afterwards he became quite withdrawn and nervous about hospital. His emotional well-being started to become a concern for me. When I first received a call from Cancer Fund for Children I had no idea what a Community Specialist was but then Neil came to our home and told us all about the support Cancer Fund for Children provides and we arranged for Neil to visit Thomas over an initial six sessions. Neil pitched all his visits to him based on his favourite things - dinosaurs and super heroes! It was amazing to see them have so much fun and the sessions were also cleverly designed to get him to talk about his illness in a light hearted way.” Read more: http://bit.ly/22lxtUv"	"Cancer Fund For Children"	1464115502	"en"

Speaking about his reasons for selecting Cancer Fund for Children  Councillor Uel Mackin said:  “Unfortunately  cancer has affected nearly all extended families in Northern Ireland and while it is a diagnosis we all dread  the added shock and cruelty of a cancer diagnosis for a child is impossible for us to imagine. I wanted to use my time as Mayor to do whatever I can to make that pain even a little more bearable.

Little Ellie Louise  now aged four  was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on March 28  2012 and has been receiving chemotherapy treatment at Belfast Royal Hospital for Sick Children. She is currently over a year into her treatment which will continue until 2014.  “She is so lively and bubbly. When she goes into a room she talks to everybody. She is just a breath of fresh air and is totally unaware about her illness. Her biggest priority is food on the table and playing. She is such a wee character and just loves all technology ” said her mum Fiona Brown.  Having received immeasurable support from a number of charities  Ellie Louise’s family were inspired to start a fundraising campaign to show their gratitude and raise awareness of the ‘life-changing’ work they do.  What started out as an idea to hold a fundraising coffee morning has snowballed as Ellie Louise’s bravery touched the hearts of the local community. A number of schools  playgroups  clubs and even complete strangers have organised a range of events and helped the Brown family raise over £10 000 in March  but the money kept coming in.  The family set up an on-line donation account and got the word out that they are fundraising for the four charities  they are the Northern Ireland Children Cancer Unit Fund  Northern Ireland Cancer Fund for Children  CLIC Sargent and Macmillan Cancer Support.  Fiona  praised the work of all the groups who she said have made the past year bearable and helped them get through the difficult times when they thought “their world was falling apart”.  Fiona and her husband Rodney said they are overwhelmed by the support and generosity of the local community that has saw the money raised to date now surpass the £25 000 mark.  “Combining the amounts of this year and last year gives a very generous amount of £25 790.  So it is incredible to think that your contribution has been part of the success that has achieved over £25 000 in one year from the local community.  This is an amazing amount of money. I can assure you that every one of these charities do fantastic work for children with cancer and their families ” said Fiona.  “We may not get a chance to personally say thanks to everyone who contributed  helped out and supported us in any way  so a big thank you to everyone. It is so humbling and overwhelming.  “A big thank you also to the charities for their help and continuing support.  The fundraising appeal was about raising awareness of childhood cancer and of the charities.  This was about giving something back that will ultimately benefit families like ourselves who have a child with cancer.”"	"Macmillan NI"	1374829927	"en"

We hadn’t realised that cancer didn’t discriminate against anyone  it didn’t even care that he was only a baby. We felt helpless and that there was nothing we could do to help him  cancer had took control of our lives.  “Cancer changed our family drastically  we went from being a normal family enjoying our children and working hard to a family who felt like we were fighting each day for survival.   “Caitriona  our Cancer Fund for Children Specialist was amazing support during this time. When Alfie  our other son was struggling to understand why Nathanael was so sick she brought us literature aimed specifically at his age group which helped us to explain treatment gently and carefully at his level.   “She also helped arrange for to stay at Cancer Fund for Children’s therapeutic short break centre  Daisy Lodge  it was the breather that we needed from hospital life and the jail that had become our own home. Not once did anyone even mention our horrible journey and what brought us there  instead the staff played games with our boys and made them feel special by giving them all the time and attention they could wish for.  “We recently got the amazing news that Nathanael is cancer free. It’s the result we have been fighting for all year. We are beyond delighted and proud. We are so thankful to Cancer Fund for Children for their support during this past year. They helped us feel like a normal family even when we were going through the worst.”  This #WorldCancerDay  the Thompson family from Randalstown are sharing their story about what was it was like when son Nathanael was diagnosed with cancer aged just nine months old. The family said that thanks to the support of Cancer Fund for Children  they were able to feel like a ‘normal’ family again.

"267048219986944_671974282827667"	"BENEFIT SANCTIONS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT HOMELESS CLAIMANTS    Homeless people are more likely to have their benefits sanctioned according to a report published by Homeless Link.    A High Cost to Pay reports that around a third of homeless people claiming Job Seekers Allowance (JSA) or Employment & Support Allowance (ESA) have been sanctioned.  In comparison  only 3% of non-homeless claimants have been sanctioned.  Homeless Link surveyed 46 of its member organisations after members reported increasing concerns about clients’ benefits being stopped.  Who is being sanctioned?  The survey found that some groups are at greater risk of being sanctioned.  These are:  • young people in receipt of JSA  • homeless people with mental health or substance use issues  • people with poor English skills  such as homeless migrants.  These findings would support other research  such as that carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation  which shows that a lack of understanding of the benefits system can lead to vulnerable people losing their benefits.    Reasons for benefit sanctions    The report found that the most common reasons for respondents in receipt of JSA receiving sanctions were  • failing to participate in the Work Programme (45%)  • failing to attend an advisory interview (28%)  Respondents indicated that interviews or appointments were often missed due to ill health or conflicting hospital and other appointments.  The report set out a number of reasons why a homeless person could miss appointments in good faith  • the letter may have been delivered incorrectly  to the wrong address or the wrong hostel resident;  • homeless people with complex needs may not be able to read or understand their letters.  •   The impact of benefit sanctions on homeless people and service providers  In its report  Homeless Link lists a number of problems which member organisations said arose as a direct result of sanctions.  • Homeless people are starting to build up rent arrears and service charge arrears  • Service charge and rent arrears also create financial difficulties for service providers.  • Increasing numbers of homeless people are in food poverty and are struggling to eat  • Homeless people may borrow money to cope while being sanctioned  which can lead to survival crime to pay off the debt  • Homeless people have reported increased anxiety and worsening of existing mental health issues.  •   Respondents to the service felt that sanctions did not help homeless people into work and did not encourage homeless people to engage more with Jobcentre Plus.

"141654136830_10152214557766831"	"Study highlights major psychological impact of cancer  Cancer Fund for Children welcomes a new study that s shed light on the major psychological impact a cancer diagnosis and treatment can have. The study by Oxford and Edinburgh University researchers which was published in the Lancet  found that as the focus is mainly placed on medically treating cancer  conditions such as depression that come about as a result of the illness are often overlooked. The study provides an evidence base to support the work we have been carrying out for many years. Our wrap-around therapeutic support services address the psychological and wellbeing needs of those affected by cancer. Our services uniquely dovetail with the clinical cancer teams across the province – and beyond. We will be focussing on this further as part of our upcoming Childhood Cancer Awareness Month Campaign in September. Keep an eye on our website next week for a more in depth discussion about this research.

Ruairi and his family took on the Bog Run for the first time last year  after his brave son Jack beat cancer for the second time.  The McCann family are planning to take on the mucky 5K run again this year to give something back to the charity that supported them throughout Jack s cancer journey.  Ruairi said:   It was shortly after we found out that Jack was in remission that we decided we wanted to give something back. We could think of no better way than getting bogging  having fun  and raising vital funds for families like ours in the process.

The service will be offered by previous cancer patients   those at high risk and also those who have a BRCA mutation predisposing them to Breast and Ovarian Cancer.  All our mentors will be people who are able to empathise and understand fears  concerns and emotions  in a unique way that many of us cannot.   All our mentors received accredited training to enhance their current skills and abilities and are provided with ongoing support from Action Cancer when they have been matched with a client. We aim to match mentors to those who have received a similar diagnosis to themselves  however our experience to date has been that support from really anyone else who has been faced with the consequences of this disease has been valuable and so if we haven’t had an exact match  we have been working with similar experiences and background.

Little Thomas  son of Angela and Paul Hearty  from Lavey  was diagnosed with a grade 4 brain tumour in December 2015 and just seven months later  his cousin Hunter  son of Amy and Ryan Kelly  from Dungiven  was diagnosed with leukaemia.  Following their diagnosis  both boys had to undergo several surgeries as well as months of gruelling chemotherapy. During their stays in hospital  the boys and their families received support from Cancer Fund for Children  including availing of short breaks at our therapeutic short facility  Daisy Lodge.  Both families are now determined to give something back to say a huge thank you for the support they have received. The families recently took on our Giant Coastal Challenge event and are now looking forward to getting muddy at this weekend’s Bog Run.  Mum Angela said:  We would like to say a massive thank you to anyone who has donated so far.

I have had the joy of getting to know her and her family as they have journeyed the initial stages of diagnosis and treatment on the Children’s Ward at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children.    “Hendrikje has an incredibly fun spirit so was keen to get stuck into some creative projects; we painted a vibrant canvas which represented her personality and as we were doing this  we reflected that having cancer doesn’t have to change who you are.   “This canvas became a backdrop to a polaroid photo project  documenting Hendrikje’s time on the ward. We had a lot of fun taking pictures  dressing up and getting the doctors and nurses involved.   “Being invited into the life-space of a young person and their family  sharing their highs and lows and getting to know them is really humbling and rewarding.”  When a teenager or young adult is in cancer treatment  it can often be a very isolating time. Frequently they are treated alongside much older patients on the adult ward  or those a lot of younger on the children’s ward.  Our Ward Support Specialist’s role is to help support these young people  discuss some of the challenges they are facing and provide them with the chance to connect with other young people who know what they are going through.  Speaking about Helen’s support  Hendrikje said:  “I really enjoyed Helen’s visits to the ward. I enjoyed painting the canvas and talking  it really gave me something to do and to think about other than my chemo  medicines and doctors”.

At that time I noticed that other cancer patients and their relatives weren’t getting  the expert support and information that was being provided by the Breast CNS.  This appeared to increase the levels of anxiety with other cancer patients at a very difficult and frightening time in their cancer journey.    I have now been a Macmillan Breast Care Nurse Specialist for 15 years and over the years I have seen more and more CNS roles being developed to help with different types of cancer.  Today’s announcement is really good news for staff and patients – this will ensure more patients will have access to this invaluable expert help and support of specialist nurses.

The Framework will determine the priorities for urban regeneration and community development policies and programmes over the coming years. It will shape the design of projects like Royal Exchange development  Public Realm improvements in town and city centres and support disadvantaged communities.    At an event to announce the appointment of contractors for the redevelopment of Bank Square Minister McCausland said: “It is very appropriate that I am announcing the publication of the Urban Regeneration and Community Development Policy Framework here in Bank Square today. This project reflects strongly one of the policy objectives contained in the Policy Framework namely to strengthen the competitiveness of our towns and cities.     “The work that will be carried out here in Bank Square will help to create a vibrant shared space which can be utilised and enjoyed by all. It will contribute to the economic regeneration of the Westside area and of the wider city centre. Modern cities require initiatives like this which improve the quality of urban design and townscape thereby improving their attractiveness to residents and visitors alike.”    The Policy Framework has been organised around four objectives which aim to provide the foundation for addressing the underlying structural problems of urban areas and help in the creation of confident  competitive and connected communities.     The Framework is designed to focus on results on the ground. This will be done by placing outcomes ahead of process; drawing on a sound evidence base; responding to the priority needs of the community; and improving the co-ordination and integration of public services.    Copies of the Framework are available from; http://www.dsdni.gov.uk/ur-community-development-policy-framework.htm"	"Supporting Communities"	1374676689	"en"

Tegan Blair  who was 11 years old when her mum was diagnosed with bowel cancer  explains how her mum s illness affected her:  “I felt different from my friends in school and I didn’t know what to do. I was shocked. I began to cry in the class. The teacher could see I was stressed. I felt really stressed. My grandma had to care for us when Mummy was having chemotherapy. Mummy was too sick and too tired to do anything with us. My mummy couldn’t drive and a voluntary driver had to take us to school. Everything was different. There were yellow sharp boxes in the kitchen for my mum to dispose of medical stuff and everywhere had to be very clean. I cried a lot.”  Talking about her experience of Young Shoulders Tegan said:  “I felt the energy as soon as I went there. We did such positive things and I had had to challenge myself often. I jumped into a river on a bouldering exercise with the group. I would never have done something like this before. The residential group work has given me confidence and I just don’t want it to end. I have now joined a sailing group in my local community and have passed my second exam.”  Thanks to the funding from Big Lottery Fund  we will be able to offer support to many more children and young people like Tegan  giving them the opportunity to share experiences and build confidence in a safe and supportive environment  at a time when they are very vulnerable.

A therapeutic short break gives families a safe and relaxing space where they can spend quality time together away from the stresses of cancer treatment and hospital visits.  Phil Alexander  Residential Services Manager at Daisy Lodge explains the difference that a short break at Daisy Lodge makes to families:  “When families arrive at Daisy Lodge  you can sense they are very stressed and anxious  and sometimes physically tired and exhausted. But when they leave after 3 or 4 days  you can see a change  something significant has happened. At the end of their short break you can see they leave less stressed  with a renewed sense of energy  a hope  and equipped to face whatever the future holds on their cancer journey.”  Whilst these short breaks are free to families who need them  unfortunately they are not free to provide.   That’s why we need your support so we can continue to provide these families with a place where they can spend precious time together and create special memories.  Listen in to Q Radio on Friday 28th April to hear more about you can support families  or to get involved now  simply go to: http://www.cancerfundforchildren.com/donate/"	"Cancer Fund For Children"	1493103600	"en"

Varför behöver du sitta i kollektivtrafiken? – För att det är skönt att slippa stå upp och för att man ska orka gå på stan. Och för att man inte ska vara helt slut när man kommer fram till skolan.  Varför älskar du att skejta och hänga med kompisar? – Jag älskar att både skejta och cykla  i somras cyklade jag mest med mina kompisar. Det är najs att hänga med skönt folk. Det är chill  vi hittar på roliga saker.  Brukar du be medresenärer att resa på sig? Hur känns det? – Nej. När jag åker hem från skolan brukar jag gå till en tidigare hållplats så att jag får en sittplats. På morgonen tar jag en tidigare buss så att det inte ska vara så mycket folk. Om det är full buss när vi drar till stan brukar det alltid finnas folk jag känner som åker då också. Då sätter vi oss tre på ett två-säte om alla inte får plats.  Vad är det jobbigaste med att ha en osynlig funktionsnedsättning i kollektivtrafiken? – Det är inget jag tänker på att jag har. Men att folk inte ser att man har ont och inte tänker på det.  Vad skulle du vilja säga till dina medresenärer? – Inte så mycket. Jag tycker mest att det borde gå fler bussar så att alla får en sittplats på bussen.  KAN DU SE VEM SOM BEHÖVER SITTA PÅ BUSSEN?

"147130095338054_1714342371950144"	"I september i år insåg jag att jag tagit min funktionsförmåga och mitt liv för givet. Jag och Unga Reumatikers generalsekreterare Kim var på utbildning. Under en föreläsning om civilsamhällets historia fick vi frågan ”Varför finns ni? Varför startade er organisation?” Vi började tänka. När det var dags för vår tur att berätta för gruppen om varför Unga Reumatiker kände jag mig kall och chockad.   Det var ett starkt ögonblick för mig som förändrade min syn på mig själv  Unga Reumatiker och reumatologins historia. Först då föll bitarna på plats samtidigt och jag kunde för första gången se bilden. Innan medicinsk revolution på 80-talet växte barn med reumatisk sjukdom upp på sjukhus och institutioner  fick ligga i sträckbänkar och stilla hela dagarna i fruktansvärda smärtor. Deras skelett formades efter rullstolen de satt i och många dog som barn  ungdomar eller ibland som unga vuxna.   Jag fick klarhet i varför vi är en självklar del av funktionsrättsrörelsen. Varför vi i solidaritet måste kämpa för LSS. Jag förstod vårdens retorik och att vår tidigare vision ”Ett bra liv för alla unga reumatiker” kanske inte alls var att sikta lågt. Det var långt ifrån sanningen. Och jag skämdes över hur naiv jag varit och kände enorm tacksamhet för forskningen som gjort det möjligt för mig att vara den jag är  full av livsglädje och mängder av drömmar. Forskningen som möjliggjort att jag kan leda Unga Reumatiker och arbeta för att vi ska höja ambitionsnivån i samhället  vården  skolan och i arbetslivet. Forskningen som möjliggjort att jag när kroppen är som värst har mediciner som gör att jag kan fortsätta trots smärta  stelhet och trötthet.   Det är fortfarande liv som tas ifrån oss på grund av systemiska engagemang vid reumatiska sjukdomar. Det är fortfarande barn  ungdomar och unga vuxna som inte svarar på eller tål de behandlingar som ger andra livet åter.  Därför  vill jag ge tillbaka. Jag vill att kommande generationer unga reumatiker ska ha ännu bättre förutsättningar och liv än mig. Jag vill att de ska kunna leva helt symptomfria. Så jag swishar pengar till Unga Reumatikerfonden och hoppas att ni gör detsamma.   Swish till forskning: 123-901 70 47 Swish till verksamheten: 123-451 34 79  Unga Reumatiker kommer 2018 göra en stor utdelning till klinisk forskning som rör barn  ungdomar och unga vuxna med reumatisk sjukdom. Jag hoppas Du vill vara med för att alla unga reumatiker ska känna livsglädje och kunna uppfylla sina drömmar.

"156390557746956_1460341934018472"	"Västerås domkyrka får unik vindturbin! Nu ska Svenska kyrkan bli självförsörjande på miljövänlig el. Det har länge pratats om solfångare på alla Sveriges kyrktak. Ofta har kyrktaken en lutning och ett geografiskt läge som lämpar sig bra för solceller och på några ställen  i Fläckebo har man faktiskt installerat solfångare och är idag självförsörjande på el.  I Västerås tar man frågan om ren el till kyrka ett par snäpp till med hjälp av så kallad VAWT  Vertical-axis wind turbine. En hypermodern stående vindgenerator med unika egenskaper.  - Enkelt uttryckt är det ett vindkraftverk som ser ut som en jättelik snurrande visp som kringgärdar tornet och som alstrar ström oavsett från vilket håll det blåser och det är en stor fördel  säger Jan-Erik Bris  projektledare. - Det är verkligen ett jätteprojekt. Vi börjar med att ta ner hela tornet som till stor del är byggt av trä  sen byggs själva stommen upp på nytt i höghållfasthetsstål innan vi klär på tornet igen med ett ytskikt som är identiskt med det som är där idag. All mekanik och själva likspänningsgeneratorn göms inne i tornet för att störa så lite som möjligt.  - Det är viktigt att allt blir rätt på ett så här unikt objekt som domkyrkan. Vi skojade ett tag om att vi skulle ha tuppen sittande på själva turbindelen  men då skulle den nog bli yr i huvet  säger Jan-Erik skrattande. För att kunna ta tillvara på all el som produceras har man startat ett eget energibolag  vitsigt kallat Gud-el. Gud-el´s uppgift är att sälja den förväntade överproduktion av el som vindkraftverket beräknas generera.  Marknadsansvarig för Gud-el  Inge Watt på Gud-El berättar: - Den här typen av vindkraftverk är extremt effektiva  så vi får antagligen ett rejält överskott och det kommer att gå tillbaka till våra medlemmarna. Planen är att Svenska kyrkans medlemmar ska kunna få del av överskottet  som en medlemsförmån. Det går också som hand i handske med med vårt skapelseansvar. - Med Gud-el kan man rosta sina bröd  köra tvättmaskinen och tanka el-bilen med gott samvete.

Gör en budget för ditt kattägande - vad kostar det att skaffa och att ha katt? 2. Ta kontakt med din lokala veterinär - gör en tidig hälsokontroll av din katt. 3. Kastrera din katt - både han- och honkatter  undantagsvis avelskatter. 4. Vaccinera din katt - för att skydda din katt från smittsamma sjukdomar. 5. Id-märk din katt - om din älskade katt skulle springa bort  så hittar den förhoppningsvis hem igen.  Tipsen kommer från Mjaus informationskampanj #förvarendakatt.

Där Charlotte  Urban tillsammans med Anders Sundström och Ingvar Edwall även guidade runt ungdomarna på Västanviks folkhögskola (som var från början Sveriges Dövas Ungdomsgård) samt visade bildspel från 1966-2016. De berättade även att det började diskuteras om ungdomsförbund redan juni 1962  på de första ’Kulturdagarna’ i Leksand som arrangerades av SDR  där flera ungdomar deltog i programmet. Självklart togs det före – och efter bilder! :)  Ps. Nu pågår arbetet med boken för fullt  planeras att vara klar till augusti. För att därefter tryckas i oktober.

Alla klubbar behöver en eller flera eldsjäl som ställer upp ideellt och Sveriges Dövas Ungdomsförbund tycker att Camilla Jablonski personifierar begreppet ideellt engagemang väldigt bra.   Camilla har engagerat sig i Göteborg Teckenspråkiga Ungdomsklubb  både som medlem och arbetsgruppsrepresentant till (bland annat) i Stadskampens arbetsgrupp som genomfördes på Björkö  Göteborg.    Vi beundrar även Camillas engagemang i Ungdomsföreningen Viljan i Vänersborg innan hon flyttade till Göteborg. Hon har arbetat ideellt med barnpassning till döva syskon-veckan i Vänersskolan med tanken bakom att Hörnet skulle få intäkter utan att få något för egen vinning.  Camilla har visat att det kan gå att engagera sig utan att behöva lyfta intressepolitiska frågor i ungdomsklubbar för att klubben ska flyta på. Det behövs en Camilla i varje ungdomsklubb!

Trots hårt motstånd från stora delar av civilsamhället.   Antalet människor som söker asyl i Sverige har minskat. När vi frågar ute i klassrummen under rollspelet På Flykt varför färre personer söker asyl i Sverige är det inte ovanligt att deltagarna gissar att färre människor är i behov av skydd. Men UNHCRs senaste rapport visar motsatsen. Antalet människor på flykt i världen ökar. Det rör sig nu om 65.6 miljoner människor. Varje minut fördrivs 20 personer på flykt.   Hjälp oss att påminna om att det låga antalet personer som söker asyl i Sverige just nu inte speglar situationen i världen. Du kan; påminna dina vänner  bli spelledare för På Flykt eller boka rollspelet till din klass/arbetsplats. Och kom ihåg 1. Det är en mänsklig rättighet att söka asyl. 2.

Därför satsar vi på kompetenshöjning och HBTQ-certifierar verksamheter som staden driver i egen regi.  • Utbildning i HBTQ-perspektiv för stadens socialsekreterare – Socialförvaltningen anordnar utbildningstillfällen för bland annat familjerättens medarbetare med fokus på HBTQ-perspektiv och föräldraskap. Tanken är att familjerättsriktlinjerna särskilt belyses utifrån HBTQ-perspektiv och inkluderar vårdnad/boende/umgänge  adoption  faderskap  surrogat."	"MP STHLM"	1501913164	"sv"

Nu är arbetet klart och nedan kan du läsa mer om fodralen och om varför Wiktoria valde att skapa dem.     Den 23 juni 2014 fick jag diagnosen diabetes typ 1. Jag kände tidigt att jag saknade ett sätt att bära med mig och förvara mina nya hjälpmedel  som insulinsprutor och blodsockermätare  och fortfarande känna mig som mig själv  som Wiktoria innan diagnosen. Jag vill känna mig precis lika snygg och fin när jag ska ta insulin vid matbordet som jag gör när jag går på stan i mina favoritkläder. Därför beslutade jag mig för att rikta mitt examensarbete från utbildningen Grafisk Design på Berghs School of Communication mot just diabetes.  I mitt projekt har jag tagit fram textilfodral i tre olika storlekar  anpassade för diabetessaker. Fodralen finns i tre mönster och kan användas tillsammans eller separat  och kommer att finnas till försäljning i begränsad upplaga under Berghs Grad Show 22-23 maj. För varje sålt fodral går 10 kr till diabetesfonden. Med det här projektet vill jag göra det möjligt för diabetiker att enkelt och snyggt kunna förvara sina diabetessaker i vardagen  på ett sätt som gör att man känner sig som sig själv och inte en patient eller sjuk.

Nu är det nästan klart  Karlstad stift och Västerås stift går samman till ett gemensamt storstift  Västeråskarlstad stift och biskop Mikael Mogren blir antagligen Sveriges första dubbelbiskop. Stiftsutredningen är en parallell till den regionutredning som staten just redovisat resultatet av.   – Det har varit på gång en längre tid berättar en glad Karin Perers  2:e Vice ordförande i Stiftsstyrelsen. På det här sättet får vi ett stift med betydligt bättre bärkraft och vi kan göra stora samordningsvinster som kommer våra församlingar tillgodo.  Även Lars Rydje  1:e vice ordförande i Stiftsstyrelsen är positiv. – Jätteroligt  jag har en sommarstuga i Säffle och där är det jättevackert.  Biskop Mikael Mogren är strålande glad.  – Vi får en hel del samordningsvinster  vissa stora andra små. Ända sedan jag tillträdde som biskop har jag haft problem med storleken på mina skrudar. Min företrädare  Thomas Söderberg  hade ju en helt annan kroppsform än jag  så skrudarna har slutat på halv stång. Nu får jag tillgång till Esbjörn Hagbergs skrudar och han och jag är nästan lika långa  perfekt!  Men Karlstad stift är just nu inne i en process med biskopsbyte kommer inte en sammanslagning väldigt olägligt? – Vi har två olika strategier för det. Karlstad stift överväger att ställa in sitt biskopsval  och spara de pengar som valet kostar  och då blir jag biskop över det gemensamma Västeråskarlstad stift  Sveriges första dubbelbiskop. Eller så blir vi två biskopar  en ”dynamisk duo” där jag blir ”biskop Genesis” och min kollega ”biskop Exodus”. – Blir det då en biskop som är kortare än mig så kanske skrudarna i Västerås passar bra  annars får vi väl dela. Det ryktas också om att Esbjörn Hagberg har en teleskopisk kräkla som man kan dra ut  den är jag väldigt intresserad av  säger biskop Mikael.  När vi frågar Karin Perers om vilka vinster Karlstad stift kommer att göra på samgåendet svävar hon först på svaret men säger sedan: – Vi har ju alla våra olika ambitiösa konstprojekt i stiftet som vi gärna exporterar  först på tur blir en vandringsutställning med biskopens folkkyrkofönster.

Rapportens frågor är ställda av barn och unga mellan 8 och 25 år till barn och unga i samma ålder  för att sätta fingret på vad de vill att vuxna ska veta. Det perspektivet gör vår rapport unik i sitt slag.    Syftet är att låta barn och unga få göra sin röst hörd  ställa sina frågor och bli lyssnade på. Det är en mänsklig rättighet  för yttrandefriheten har ingen nedre åldersgräns.   Lägerelden är en central del i scouting  där träffas vi och där äger samtalet rum. Därför kommer vi under året fokusera på lägerelden i mycket av det vi gör. Rapporten kommer ut om några veckor och redan nästa vecka kommer vi bjuda in makthavare i sociala medier så dela gärna när du ser  för då är du med och sätter fingret på barn och ungas perspektiv. 🔥"	"Scouterna"	1518793480	"sv"

Berätta om var och hur du var engagerad i Ungdomsförbundet? Jag gick med i Ungdomsförbundet 1990  den bärande idén var att komma in gratis på rockkonserter som förstahjälpare och kanske rädda någons liv. I själva verket satt jag av tiden på olika motocrossbanor i Västsverige. Men vi hade väldigt roligt. 1992 började jag på Röda Korsets Folkhögskola Stockholm  vi bildade en förening på skolan och drev arbetet och kampanjerna mot personminor  mot vapenexport och mot rasism. Vi gjorde flera mycket uppmärksammade aktioner och jag fördjupade mitt engagemang. Tillsammans med min kompis Henrik Dahl och Margareta Nylander på förbundssekretariatet började jag 1993 med att arrangera så kallade Toleransresor  till koncentrationsläger i Tyskland. Jag blev invald i Centrala rådet (som förbundsstyrelsen hette då) 1994 och 1996 blev jag vald till ordförande samtidigt som beslutet fattades om att organisationen skulle vara självständig.  Berätta om något roligt/speciellt minne? Ja oj  vad ska man välja? En kul grej var när jag åkte med Svenska delegationen till internationella Röda Korskonferensen i Geneve  jag hade långt ostyrigt hår och skägg  dåtidens hipster. Polis och tull plockade mig direkt vid ankomst och påbörjade  förhör   lite pinsamt det här tänkte jag  men Christina Magnusson (Prinsessan Christina)  som då var ordförande i Röda Korset  uppenbarade sig plötsligt i dörren och garanterade att jag var en seriös och tillförlitlig person.  Med detta återfick jag min frihet... Några år senare fick Christina lösa ut mig i en annan besvärlig situation då jag misstogs för att vara katolsk präst  men det är en helt annan och lång historia.  Vad hände sen? Idag är jag Sverigechef på Rädda Barnen. Efter att jag slutat som ordförande 2000 valde jag att fortsätta arbeta i det civila samhället  jag har jobbat med politisk påverkan  ansvarig för MR-Dagarna  Generalsekreterare i Svenska Freds- och Skiljedomsföreningen med mera. Men på något sätt har jag hållit kontakten med Svenska Röda Korset och Ungdomsförbundet under hela den här tiden.  Vad har ditt engagemang betytt för dig? Extremt mycket. Ungdomsförbundet var min skola. Där lärde jag mig väldigt mycket av det jag idag kan. Jag kan  trots att det är 20 år sedan och en helt annan tid ofta  ofta och återkommande hämta inspiration från vad vi gjorde då. Än idag använder jag tankar och idéer som vi utvecklade i Ungdomsförbundet och än idag umgås jag och arbetar dagligen med människor från den tiden. Runt mig ser jag spåren av det vi höll på med och blir jättestolt  på mitt jobb hänger Nobels fredspris som gavs till kampanjen mot personminor  jag följer Clowner utan Gränser som bara var ett litet kompisgäng när vi började samarbetet 1998  jag dricker Fair trade-kaffe och minns när vi var med och startade Rättvisemärkt. Häromveckan träffade jag  Ericsson response  som Ungdomsförbundet försökte stoppa genom en artikel på DN debatt. Jag kommer fortfarande ihåg samtalet när Charlotte Petri Gornitzka (då biträdande generalsekreterare) ringde och skällde ut mig för den... Idag tänker jag att det nog var lite bra att vi inte lyckades den gången ;-)  #rkuf #frivillig #engagemang"	"Röda Korsets Ungdomsförbund"	1451037061	"sv"
